# 📊 Automated Internal Dashboard – Streamlit + MySQL

A robust, cloud-deployed internal dashboard engineered using **Python (Streamlit)** and **MySQL**, purpose-built to deliver **real-time data visualization**, **automated reporting**, and **secure multi-user access** for streamlining organizational operations.

This production-grade system leverages a modular backend architecture, optimized SQL queries, and asynchronous data handling to ensure dynamic, scalable, and reliable performance. It replaces manual workflows with an end-to-end automated solution — from **data ingestion** to **interactive UI rendering** — enabling users to authenticate securely, explore live metrics, and generate downloadable reports in a single interface.
