# 📊 Automated Internal Dashboard – Streamlit + MySQL

A robust, cloud-deployed internal dashboard engineered using **Python (Streamlit)** and **MySQL**, purpose-built to deliver **real-time data visualization**, **automated reporting**, and **secure multi-user access** for streamlining organizational operations.

This production-grade system leverages a modular backend architecture, optimized SQL queries, and asynchronous data handling to ensure dynamic, scalable, and reliable performance. It replaces manual workflows with an end-to-end automated solution — from **data ingestion** to **interactive UI rendering** — enabling users to authenticate securely, explore live metrics, and generate downloadable reports in a single interface.

🌐 Real-Time Location-Based Alert System
In addition to internal data monitoring, the system implements a real-time alert engine based on dynamic geolocation data (latitude and longitude). It monitors live coordinates and automatically triggers alerts when specific geospatial conditions are met, such as:

Entering or exiting defined geofences

Proximity to high-risk zones or custom-defined areas

Real-time tracking and alerting for emergency response or field operations

🔧 Location Alert Features

Live alert generation from continuous GPS streams

Customizable geofence and threshold settings

Integration-ready with webhooks, SMS, email, or push notifications

Scalable and API-friendly architecture using modern frameworks
